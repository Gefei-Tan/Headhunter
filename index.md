### Introduction 
Headhunter is a headtracking midi controller. It allows you to use your head to control your midi-compatible instrument. Headhunter uses sensors in your smartphone to do headtracking, and it translates these data to corresponding MIDI messages in Max. You can easily customize Headhunter by remapping head movements to different midi messages.

### Video Demo

In this demo, I mapped the pitch bend to the yaw axis. So you will hear this vibrato/pitch bend effect when I shake my head.
I also mapped the volume of my synth pad layer to the pitch axis, so you can hear the synth sound fading in and out as I look up and down.

Music in the demo is written by myself. If you like this kind of music, feel free to check out my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62j0qdzoFFmlWArG9rjw5y?si=134dd3bfddf4407d">Spotify Playist</a> of songs I wrote!
